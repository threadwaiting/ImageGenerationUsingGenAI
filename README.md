# Image Generation Using GenAI
Introduction
Using GenAI allows individuals to create fresh images based on specific prompts effortlessly. Advanced machine learning algorithms are utilized to generate unique visuals that match the given prompt seamlessly.

By simply entering a prompt, users can quickly generate new images without requiring any design skills. The GenAI image generation models are trained on extensive datasets, utilizing this knowledge to effortlessly produce new visuals.

By employing generative adversarial networks (GANs), they are capable of generating images that closely resemble the provided prompts. This versatile capability finds applications across various fields, including website graphics, marketing materials, and advertising campaigns.

This method offers a fast and efficient way of generating images, often delivering impressive results in terms of both quality and relevance.

Implementation
We will use the ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning which uses a diffusion distillation method that achieves new state-of-the-art in one-step/few-step 1024px text-to-image generation based on Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL). It combines progressive and adversarial distillation to achieve a balance between quality and mode coverage.
